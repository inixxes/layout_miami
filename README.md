This is my first landing page which were constructed during my first 1.5 months of studiyng in Mate Academy. It was created with HTML, CSS and just a few lines of JS code which prevents page from scrolling while nav menu is open.

- [Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/nHz8bflIwJaWP3P99vKTH5/miami_home_new?node-id=0%3A1)

- [DEMO LINK](https://inixxes.github.io/layout_miami/)

If you want to run this code on your local machine, clone this repo, then install all dependencies and packages with npm install in miami_layout folder. To start a server enter npm run start in your IDE terminal.
